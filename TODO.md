# Todo

- [ ] Fix the sizes so this can be applied to other stylesheets without a img size defined (as used in index.html)
- [ ] Fix the size of the error image (use a background image instead of content url). 
- [ ] Improve doc / help / usage of this CSS
- [ ] Possibly accept new name suggestion for this project.
